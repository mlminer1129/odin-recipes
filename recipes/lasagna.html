                <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>

        <h5>Steps</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place pumpkin on a baking sheet and roast in oven until browned and tender, 
                    about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, grill eggplant on a charcoal grill or fry in a 
                    skillet, turning once, until charred and tender, 10 to 15 minutes. 
                    Halve tomatoes and place on baking sheet in oven for last 15 minutes of 
                    pumpkin time; cook until tender and wrinkly.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, stir together ricotta, feta, pesto, eggs, salt and pepper 
                    until well mixed. Fold roasted pumpkin into ricotta mixture.</li>
                <li>Spoon half of the tomato sauce into a 9x13 baking dish. Lay two pasta sheets 
                    over the sauce. Arrange a single layer of eggplant slices over pasta and top 
                    with half the ricotta mixture. Cover with two more pasta sheets. 
                    Arrange the roasted tomatoes evenly over the sheets and spoon the remaining 
                    half the ricotta mixture over the tomatoes. Sprinkle with half the mozzarella. 
                    Top with remaining two sheets of pasta. Pour remaining tomato sauce over all 
                    and sprinkle with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven 30 to 40 minutes, until golden and bubbly.</li>
