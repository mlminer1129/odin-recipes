                <li>1/3 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
                <li>1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
                <li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cups of white sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
                <li>1/4 cup irish cream liqueur</li>
            </ul>

        <h5>Steps</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix together the cookie crumbs, confectioners' 
                    sugar and 1/3 cup cocoa. Add melted butter and stir until well mixed. Pat into the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. 
                    Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes; set aside. Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, white sugar, 1/4 cup cocoa and flour. Beat at medium speed until well blended 
                    and smooth. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Blend in the sour cream and Irish cream liqueur; 
                    mixing on low speed. Pour filling over baked crust.</li>
                <li>Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), and 
                    continue baking for 60 minutes.</li>
                <li>With a knife, loosen cake from rim of pan. Let cool, then remove the rim of pan. Chill before serving. If your cake cracks, 
                    a helpful tip is to dampen a spatula and smooth the top, then sprinkle with some chocolate wafer crumbs.</li>
            </ol>
