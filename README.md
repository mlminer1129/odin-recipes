# odin-recipes
This is the first project from The Odin Project

In this project we will be demonstarating some of the beginning parts of html by creating a home page along with a few recipes.

Iteration 1: Initial structure (Headers, links, and lists)

Iteration 2: Recipe Page (Three pages for three recipes)

Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content (Pictures, descriptions, and mixing/cooking instructions)

Iteration 4: Add More Recipes (After creating the first recipe page and linking two more were made)
